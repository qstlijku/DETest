# Setup

1. Run Disrupt Editor, it will automatically create a settings.xml for you to fill in
2. Assuming Z:/scratch/bin is where you extracted each of the fat/dat files, add them to searchPaths like so:
patchDir is where modified files like wlu and cbatch are written. Files in the patchDir will always take precedence
```xml
<searchPaths>
    <Elem>Z:/scratch/bin/patch_unpack/</Elem>
    <Elem>Z:/scratch/bin/dlc_solo_unpack/</Elem>
    <Elem>Z:/scratch/bin/dlc_solo_english_unpack/</Elem>
    <Elem>Z:/scratch/bin/dlc_pill_people_unpack/</Elem>
    <Elem>Z:/scratch/bin/windy_city_unpack/</Elem>
    <Elem>Z:/scratch/bin/windy_city_english_unpack/</Elem>
    <Elem>Z:/scratch/bin/shaders_unpack/</Elem>
    <Elem>Z:/scratch/bin/shadersobj_unpack/</Elem>
    <Elem>Z:/scratch/bin/sound_unpack/</Elem>
    <Elem>Z:/scratch/bin/sound_english_unpack/</Elem>
